## 1) Introduction
This python repository approximates the interest rate curve construction,  
extrapolation and shocks described by the European insurance regulator EIOPA in the 
Solvency 2 regime.

The first two approaches of the below are implemented:
1) Standard model
    * Smith-Wilson-Extrapolation
    * Interest rate shocks (relative)
2) Review of Solvency II 2020
    * Alternative extrapolation
    * Interest rate shocks (relative + absolute)
3) EC communication 2021 (published 22.09.2021)
    * tbd

As mentioned, the script is simply an approximation and toy project that may 
contain substantial errors. 

Please let me know if you have any comments or feedback.
