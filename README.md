-----------------------------------------
## 1) Introduction
This python repository approximates the interest rate curve construction and 
extrapolation described by the European insurance regulator EIOPA in the Solvency 2 regime.

The two approaches below are implemented:
1) Standard model
    * Smith-Wilson-Extrapolation
    * Relative interest rate shocks
2) 2020 review of Solvency II
    * Alternative extrapolation
    * New interest rate shocks (relative + absolute)

As mentioned, the script is simply an approximation and toy project that may 
contain substantial errors. 

Please let me know if you have any comments or feedback.
